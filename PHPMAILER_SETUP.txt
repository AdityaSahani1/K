PHPMailer Manual Installation Guide
For InfinityFree or Hosting Without Composer
========================================

Since InfinityFree doesn't support Composer, you need to manually install PHPMailer.

STEPS TO INSTALL PHPMAILER MANUALLY:

1. Download PHPMailer from GitHub:
   - Go to: https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer
   - Click the green "Code" button
   - Select "Download ZIP"

2. Extract the ZIP file on your computer

3. Upload the PHPMailer folder:
   - In the extracted folder, find the "src" folder inside PHPMailer
   - Create a folder called "phpmailer" in your website's root directory (same level as api/, js/, etc.)
   - Inside the "phpmailer" folder, upload the "src" folder from the downloaded files
   
   Your folder structure should look like this:
   
   your-website/
   ├── api/
   ├── js/
   ├── config/
   ├── phpmailer/          ← Create this folder
   │   └── src/            ← Upload this from the downloaded files
   │       ├── PHPMailer.php
   │       ├── SMTP.php
   │       ├── Exception.php
   │       └── (other files)
   ├── index.html
   └── (other files)

4. That's it! The code is already set up to detect and use the manual installation.

TESTING:
- Try registering a new user or using the "Forgot Password" feature
- The system will automatically use the manually installed PHPMailer
- Check your email for OTP verification or password reset

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Make sure your SMTP settings are correct in config/config.php
- InfinityFree may have restrictions on email sending (ports, frequency)
- You may need to use port 587 or 465 for SMTP
- Consider using Gmail App Password or another SMTP service
